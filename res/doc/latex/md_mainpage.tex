liblac is the Linear Algebra Library (written in C). This is purely a personal project and is not at all intended for commercial or production use. No serious attempts at optimization have been made. If you are looking for a more robust linear algebra library written in C, please check out \href{https://github.com/g-truc/glm}{\texttt{ GLM}}.\hypertarget{md_mainpage_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Philosophy}{Philosophy}}\label{md_mainpage_autotoc_md3}
The reason I created this library was primarily for learning purposes. To complement this, I\textquotesingle{}ve sprinkled in additional comments explaining some of the more complex concepts on top of the vanilla API docs generated by Doxygen. The library is minimally obfuscated at the expense of performance. There are certainly much more efficient algorithms for doing vector and matrix mathematics, especially with modern hardware features such as SIMD. These tend to make code less portable, however, which was a minor consideration as well. You will notice that the APIs are written in a functional manner (although not purely functional). This is to say that the mutation of input parameters is generally avoided, except for the output parameter. This places the responsibility of managing owners on you, the maintainer, not on the library. Each API function is named following a specific convention. Each API function begins with lac\+\_\+, which is intentionally done to reduce namespace collisions and to differentiate from other libraries. Additionally, each API function follows a verb-\/subject structure. This makes it easy to anticipate the names of similar functionality. For example, given that there is a function called lac\+\_\+add\+\_\+vec3(), is follows that there exists a function called lac\+\_\+subtract\+\_\+vec3(). Parameters are ordered as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item First class input data members
\item First class output data members
\item Second class input data members
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

First class data members are directly related to the subject of the function i.\+e. the operands of the operation. Second class data members include parameters that affect the operation in some way, but that are only loosely related to the subject. Examples include scaling constants, angles for rotation, boolean flags, etc.
